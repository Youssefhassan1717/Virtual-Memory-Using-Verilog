<h2 align="center">Project Overview</h2>

The virtual memory project implemented in Verilog consists of six essential files. These files work together to create an efficient virtual memory system that enhances memory management and address translation.
<h2 align="center">Project Files</h2>

    sim file: The sim file contains the simulation code that tests the virtual memory system, including the TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer) and cache. It verifies the correctness and functionality of the virtual memory system as a whole.

    test file: The test file focuses solely on testing the cache module. It evaluates the cache's efficiency, hit rate, miss rate, and cache replacement policies. This test ensures the cache performs optimally and retrieves data efficiently.

    cache file: The cache file represents the cache module in the virtual memory system. It handles the caching mechanism and aims to improve memory access speed by storing frequently accessed data.

    main memory file: The main memory file represents the primary memory module in the virtual memory system. It stores data and instructions actively used by the processor.

    page_table file: The page_table file represents the page table module. It performs address translation by mapping virtual addresses to physical addresses, enabling efficient memory management.

    tlb file: The tlb file represents the Translation Lookaside Buffer module. The TLB is a cache that stores recently accessed virtual-to-physical address translations, reducing the need for frequent page table accesses and improving system performance.

<h2 align="center">Project Goals</h2>

The primary goals of this project include:

    Implementing a virtual memory system using Verilog to facilitate efficient memory management and address translation.

    Designing and optimizing the cache and TLB components to reduce memory access latency and improve overall system performance.

    Developing modules for the main memory, page table, and TLB to handle memory operations and address translation efficiently.

    Creating a robust simulation environment to test and validate the virtual memory system's functionality and correctness.

<h2 align="center">Usage and Integration</h2>

To use and integrate the virtual memory system, follow these steps:

    Clone this repository or download the project files.

    Set up a Verilog development environment, such as Xilinx ISE or Vivado.

    Open the project in the Verilog development environment.

    Customize the configurations and parameters based on your specific requirements.

    Compile and synthesize the Verilog modules.

    Program the synthesized design onto an FPGA or run it in a simulation environment.

    Interface the virtual memory system with a CPU or a memory controller.

    Test and evaluate the functionality and performance of the virtual memory system using appropriate test cases and benchmarks.

<h2 align="center">Test Cases</h2>

To ensure the correctness and efficiency of the virtual memory system, several test cases can be implemented:

    TLB and Cache Simulation Test: Use the sim file to simulate various memory access scenarios. This test validates the functionality of the TLB and cache components when working together. Verify that the TLB caches recent translations and that the cache efficiently stores frequently accessed data, minimizing memory access latency.

    Cache Test: Utilize the test file to test the cache module independently. Evaluate the cache's performance by analyzing hit rate, miss rate, and cache replacement policies. Ensure that the cache retrieves data efficiently and handles cache misses by fetching required data from the main memory or secondary storage.

    Address Translation and TLB Miss Test: Generate a set of virtual addresses to evaluate the accuracy of the address translation mechanism. Use the sim file to simulate TLB misses and ensure the virtual memory system correctly retrieves translations from the page table when necessary.

    Data Transfer Test: Measure the efficiency of data transfer between the main memory and secondary storage. Evaluate the system's ability to handle large data transfers and ensure data integrity is maintained throughout the transfer process.

These test cases provide comprehensive coverage of the virtual memory system, validating its address translation, cache functionality, TLB efficiency, and data transfer capabilities.
